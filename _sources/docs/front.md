# Polar Climate Change

This is a short sequence of lectures on polar climate change in 2021/22 semester 
for upper-year undergraduate and graduate students at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, 
National Taiwan University, written by [Yu-Chiao Liang](https://littleyuchiao.wixsite.com/yuchiaol/).

This course aims to introduce the polar climate change and its interaction with regional and global climate. 
We will overview of the fast-changing polar cryosphere in the past decades, 
and discuss the two-way interactions of the changing polar climate and 
lower-latitude atmospheric and oceanic circulations at various spatiotemporal scales, 
with cause-and-effect and signal-to-noise issues emphasized.

We will use a hierarchical modelling approach with different complexity in attempt to 
understand the possible atmospheric circulation changes in response to polar warming. 
The anticipated results will be compared to the observations and the state-of-the-art global climate model simulations, 
for example CMIP5/6 or Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project.

These lectures were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  They are
intended mainly as a demonstration of these tools.
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.
