# Cause of Arctic Amplification

> Arctic Amplification is a prominent feature of global warming!

### What is Arctic Amplification (AA)?

- Near-surface of the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes are warming at rates double that of lower latitudes (Cohen et al., 2014).

### Why AA is important?

- Local impacts on human dimension
- Local impacts on nature system
- Remote impacts

### Quantitative definition of AA

- Arctic amplification factor (AAF): Arctic surface air temperature change divided by global surface air temperature change.
- Arctic amplification efficacy (AAE): AAF$_{XX}$ divided by AAF$_{CO_2}$, where $XX$ is the forcing agent.

### AA in Observational Records and Models

- Paleoclimate records
- Present-day observations
- General circulation model
- State-of-the-art climate model and future projection

### AA Structure

- AA has distinct seasonal and meridional structures.

### Physical Mechanisms Causing AA

### Climate Forcing

- Greenhouse gases. For example: carbon doxide, ozone-depleting substances, methane.
- Aerosols 
- Solar irradiance 
- [Land use and cover changes](https://littleyuchiao.wixsite.com/yuchiaol/recruiting)
- Climate forcing details can impact the magnitude of AA [(Stuecker et al. 2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0339-y)

### Climate Feedbacks

A thorough review of these feedbacks' contributions to Arctic warming can be seen in [Goosse et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04173-0). We will go through each feedback in class.

- Temperature feedbacks:
  - Planck feedback
  - Lapse-rate feedback
- Surface albedo feedback
- Water vapor feedback
- Cloud feedback
- Other feedbacks:
  - Northward shift of boreal forest and overall greening of the Arctic
  - Large evaporation increases in low latitudes
  - Oceanic heat fluxes in Arctic Ocean

### Poleward Energy Transport

- Atmospheric transport:
  - Dry static energy
  - Moiste static energy
- Oceanic transport
  - Circulation anomalies
  - Heat anomalies
- Remote forcing from tropics?
- Timescale affects the portion of atmospheric and oceanic heat transports

### Climate State Dependence
