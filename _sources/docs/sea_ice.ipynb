    "### What is sea ice?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sea ice is formed in the salty ocean water (-1.8°C)\n",
    "- Sea ice appears in Arctic and Antarctica. Sea ice can form in Bohai Bay.\n",
    "- Sea ice covers about 25 million square km of the Earth’s surface (about 2.5 times the area of Canada, or 15% of world’s ocean).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification of Sea Ice\n",
    "\n",
    "- By age: first-year v.s. multi-year\n",
    "- New ice: < 10 cm thick\n",
    "- Young ice: 10-30 cm\n",
    "  - grey ice: 10-15 cm\n",
    "  - grey-white ice: 15-30 cm\n",
    "- First-year ice: > 30 cm, but melt out in melting season (summer)\n",
    "- Multi-year ice: 2-4 m, survived melting season\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sea Ice Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Phase diagram of salt water\n",
    "- Ice growth process\n",
    "  - Rough ocean: pancake ice -> rafting or ridging -> cementing or consolidation -> sheet ice \n",
    "  - Calm ocean: grease ice -> nilas -> rafting -> congelation ice -> sheet ice\n",
    "- Salinity and brine\n",
    "- The role of waves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-year Sea Ice\n",
    "\n",
    "- Freshwater supplies for polar expeditions.\n",
    "- Multi-year ice has different electromagnetic properties from first-year ice, so that satellite sensors can distinguish them.\n",
    "- More multi-year ice in Arctic than in Antarctica.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Freezing degree days (FDD in deg C).\n",
    "- Thickness (cm) = 1.33xFDD^0.58 (Lebedev 1938).\n",
    "- Snow cover slows the growth of ice.\n",
    "- Albedo effect (melting pond -> 0.4-0.5 and surface 0.75).\n",
    "- Thermodynamic equilibrium thickness (no heat transfer): 3 meters in Arctic; 1-2 meters in Antarctica. \n",

    "### Sea Ice Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamics does not direct contribute to sea ice formation or reduction.\n",
    "- Winds\n",
    "  - generally sea ice that drifts freely moves at 2 percent of the wind speed\n",
    "  - sea ice surface roughness (angle).\n",
