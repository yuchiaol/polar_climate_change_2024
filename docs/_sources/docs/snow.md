# Snow

### Snow Characteristics

- Colors
- Crystal structure

### Snow Formation

- A general rule: snow will not form if the ground temperature is at least 5°C.
- Temperature vs moisture (Antarctica’s Dry Valley!)
- Most snowflakes are less than 1.3 cm.
- Snow seasonality

### Vertical Profile of Ground Snow

- Daytime temperature inversion

### Snow Water Equivalent

- Definition: the thickness of water that would result from melting a given layer of snow.
- 25 cm of fresh snow ~= 0.25-10 cm of water.
- New snow in the U.S. contains a water-to-snow ratio between 4-10%.

### Snow and Weather

- Snow forecasting remains challenging.
- Follow storm tracks in boreal winter.
- Blizzard and bomb cyclone
- Thunder snow (summer)
- Polar vortex

### Snow and Vegetation

- Wind direction
- Canopy snow
- Tree type
- Clearings

### Snowpack Energy Budget

- Snow albedo
- Latent heat of snow
- Turbulent transfer

### Snow and Rain Temperature

### Snow and Water Flow

### Lake Effect Snow

### Snow and Climate Change

- Snow trend and variability
- Snow as a forcing to affect atmospheric circulation?
