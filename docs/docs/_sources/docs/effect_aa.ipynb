    "\n",
    "> Arctic-Midlatitude Linkage has been hotly discussed and debated in the past years. [Here's an an article on “CarbonBrief”](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-is-arctic-warming-linked-to-polar-vortext-other-extreme-weather?fbclid=IwAR3IdscKbEHYVgGdkInmUMBzArEswKu51fGUOQG4OazrNg5MqXQUtQ5hWkQ).\n",

    "### Brief History of Arctic Mid-latitude Linkage Study\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1914: Swedish meteorologist Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson  \n",
    "- 1924: Russian oceanographer Wlaimir Juljewitsch Wiese\n",
    "- 1973: R. L. Newson published a Nature paper, which used GCM to study Arctic sea-ice impacts on the atmosphere.  \n",
    "- 2010: J. A. Screen published a Nature paper, which showed that Arctic sea ice plays a central role in Arctic Amplification.\n",
    "- 2012: J. A. Francis and S. T. Vavrus published a GRL paper, which linked Arctic warming to extreme events in midlatitudes.\n",
    "- 2013: Elizabeth A. Barnes’s GRL paper (argued the Arctic-midlatitude linkage).\n",
    "- 2014: J. M. Wallace’s Science paper.\n",
    "- 2014: J. Cohen’s review paper on Nature Geoscience (stratosphere).\n",
    "- 2020: J. Cohen’s review paper on Nature Climate Change (divergent consensus)\n",
