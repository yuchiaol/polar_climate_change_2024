# Overview of Arctic

> \"The region surrounding the North Pole consists of a large ocean surrounded by land. 
> This ocean, called the Arctic Ocean, is like no other ocean on Earth; 
> and because of its special location and climate, the lands that surround it are unique.\" 
> -- [NSIDC All About Arctic Climatology and Meteorology](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/arctic-meteorology/index.html)

### Arctic Definitions

### Arctic Exploration

- Brief histroy
- Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate [(MOSAiC)](https://mosaic-expedition.org/)
- I invite [Dr Ying-Chih Fang](https://mosaic-expedition.org/profile/ying-chih-fang/), who is particitating in MOSAiC project, to give a seminar talk in September.
