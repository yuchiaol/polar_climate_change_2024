### Stratospheric Polar Vortex

- Displacement
- Splitting 
- 2020-2021 polar vortex evolution

### Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW)

- SSW and polar vortex breakdown
- Days 0-30 T anomalies following SSW

### Definition of SSW

The most widely used definition of SSW is following [Charlton and Polvani (2007)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/20/3/jcli3996.1.xml):

“the reversal of the daily-mean zonal-mean zonal winds from westerly to easterly at 60◦ N latitude and 10 hPa from November to April (by CP07, wind reversals must be separated by 20 consecutive days of westerly winds and must return to westerly for at least 10 consecutive days prior to 30 April, to be classified as a mid-winter SSW.).“

Temperature information can be dropped because of thermal wind balance!

### SSW Dynamical Frameworks

- Large-scale planetary wave propagating upward
  - Planetary wave propagating upward – Charney-Drazin criterion 
  - Baroclinic instability
  - Upscale cascade from synoptic-scale waves
  - Topography
  - Land-sea contrast
- Planetary Wave Forcing
  - SSWs only happen with sufficiently strong planetary wave forcing from the troposphere.
  - SSWs require a pulse of anomalously strong wave forcing from the troposphere to initiate.“
  - Wave1 -> bottom-up
  - Wave2 -> top-down
- Wave-mean flow interactions and dissipation
  - EP flux
  - Heat budget analysis
  - PV perspective

### External Influences on SSWs

- QBO 
- ENSO 
- 11-year solar cycle 
- MJO
- snow cover
- sea ice

### Dynamical Downward Propagation

Tropospheric anomalies should be proportional to stratospheric ones!

- Wave driving (EP flux divergence) -> downward control (x)
- Wave absorption and reflection. (x)
- Baroclinic eddies (v)
- Stratospheric PV anomalies (v? too weak)

### Surface Signature of SSW’s Downward Influences

- Midlatitude surface impacts
- Oceanic impacts
- Tropical impacts
