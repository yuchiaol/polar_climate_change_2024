    "\n",
    "“the reversal of the daily-mean zonal-mean zonal winds from westerly to easterly at 60◦ N latitude and 10 hPa from November to April (by CP07, wind reversals must be separated by 20 consecutive days of westerly winds and must return to westerly for at least 10 consecutive days prior to 30 April, to be classified as a mid-winter SSW.).“\n",
