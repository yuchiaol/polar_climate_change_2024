# Polar Climate Change

These materials are suppporting lectures of Polar Climate Change in 2021/22 semester 
for upper-year undergraduate and graduate students at the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences](http://www.as.ntu.edu.tw/index.php/eng), 
[National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), 
written by [Yu-Chiao Liang](https://littleyuchiao.wixsite.com/yuchiaol/).

This course aims to introduce the Arctic climate change and its interaction with regional and global climate. 
We will overview the fast-changing polar cryosphere in the past decades, 
and discuss the two-way interactions of the changing Arctic climate and 
lower-latitude (midlatitudes and tropics) atmospheric and oceanic circulations at various spatiotemporal scales, 
along with cause-and-effect and signal-to-noise issues addressed.

We will use an idealized modelling approach
in attempt to understand the possible atmospheric circulation changes in response to polar warming. 
The anticipated results will be compared to the observations and the state-of-the-art global climate model simulations, 
for example CMIP5/6 or [Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/CMIP6/PAMIP/).
